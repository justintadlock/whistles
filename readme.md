# Whistles

Tabs, toggles, accordions, and all that jazz. Bells and whistles done right.

## Description

Whistles was not born as "just another tabs plugin".  It was born out of the idea that we need to get rid of all other plugins like this and start from scratch.

It seems to me that tabs plugins have been clunky and extremely hard to use over the years.  Whistles seeks to rectify this by making it easy to manage tabs, toggles, accordions, and other things that need to be embedded into a page.

### So, what is Whistles? Are whistles? Can you whistle?

Whistles is a plugin that creates a new content type called "whistle" and a new taxonomy called "whistle group".  The plugin allows you to create individual whistles and organize them into whistle groups however you see fit.  Then, it allows you to embed whistle groups into posts using the `[whistles]` shortcode or adding it via the Whistles widget.

You can also decide how you want to display your whistles.  In the current version of the plugin, they can be displayed as:

* Tabs
* Toggles
* Accordions

The great thing about this method is that you're pretty much able to put whatever content you want into your whistles.  It's no different than writing a post or page.  You can insert text, images, media, and even other shortcodes.

### Features

* "Whistles" screen in the admin under "Appearance" for creating whistles.
* "Whistle Groups" screen in the admin under "Appearance" for organizing whistles.
* `[whistles]` shortcode for displaying whistles.
* "Add Whistles" media button above the post content editor for inserting whistles.
* "Whistles" widget under the "Appearance > Widgets" admin screen.

## Changelog

### Version 1.1.1

* Set the post type and taxonomy to `'public' => false`. This should keep them from showing up in things like automatically-generated sitemaps.

### Version 0.1.0

* Everything's new!
